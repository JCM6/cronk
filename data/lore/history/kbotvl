These Books describe both future, past and current events. The Lady Roechelle exists beyond these events and should be considered outside of them alongside the Nolithom and Corvantus. They were once mortal and know the true secret of the world of Corfael.

Itaphes and Stentams

The being of power Itaphes forged all that is of this world from light and fire while his foil Stentams formed all that is spirit with all that remained in opposition of light and fire, ash and shadow. These two beings fought tirelessly against one another for thousands of years forming spheres of coalesced power and perfection. These objects of embodied aspects of the extremity of light as well as dark. The reason behind their conflict arises not of a bearing they hold against each other, but rather a force of inevitability like a falling stone. One may flee the other, but , a unification of their twin might is inevitable and leaves behind remnants of their orbits. These remnants are recorded as taking the form of cykiric objects. From these cykirics all that we know of the spirit and matter have come forth and will be. These beings however much they contend against one another are not be thought as being in ever constant combat with one another. There are times where they sit at a distance, maneuvering opposite on another. This period of separation creates a being of both wills that is composed of both of their key elements. This being is known as Thalin, who only is capable of existing between the two primal forces. Thalin embodies the hope, peace and prosperity that come from insight into the polar beings of creation. Thalin's existence is temporary and fleeting, but is similarly eternal through a constant rebirth through the movements and conflicts of Itaphes and Stentams.

Eniglamon
The years spent by the Volidean people as refuges from their conflict with Greysand after a large majority of their people and land was laid waste after the closing of the Greysand Gate. The story ends with the Volidean people finding shelter with the immortal Roechelle. Roechelle finally shares some of the darkerr secrets of Corfael with a select few Volidean.

Greysand, the substance know to some as the creeping death or vapid demise is an elemental substance that has a unknown origin despite the fact that it is known to come from beyond what was once known as the Greysand Gate. It is widely believed that beyond the Gate lies the place of origin for the Greysand, but this is only surmised as only one is known to have entered the gate and presumably destroyed it from the other side. What remains of the gate today is surrounded by large pools of Greysand and an ichor substance that upon contact with flesh dissolves it instantly. The Volidean people who have had a longer struggle against this pervasive force have been forced out of their homeland due to the destruction caused by their conflict with the Greysand force and the ultimate destruction of the Gate. The destruction of the Gate produced a shuddering of the ground so strong that it flattened most structures within a large radius. This sundering force also propelled ichor into the sky for miles causing even more destruction.The resulting landscape of war and the Gate's destruction has forced many Volideans to  leave their homeland seeking fortune elsewhere in the world.
