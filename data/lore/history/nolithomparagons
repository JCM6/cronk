1. WE ARE TRAVELERS

2. CONSTANTLY MOVING FORWARD

3. AND LOOKING BACK

4. ALONE...AND AS ONE

5. WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TRY

6. FOR INSATIABLE CURIOSITY

7. FOR OUR FEAR FOR WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IF WE DON'T

8. YOU ARE THAT EXPLORER NOW

9. WE WILL SAY GOODBYE

10. AND YOU WILL LOOK BACK ONE LAST TIME

11. AND KNOW THAT WHEREVER YOU GO

12. WE WILL BE WITH YOU. 

....

WE ARE THE PROTECTORS

ALWAYS SEEKING BALANCE

UNITY AND PRESERVATION IS WHAT WE CRAVE

A SINGULAR SOLIDARITY BINDS OUR PURPOSE

TO SHIELD THE WEAK FROM THOSE WHO WOULD HARM

TO STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS DEFENDED

YOU ARE THAT PROTECTOR NOW

WE WILL SAY WELCOME

AND YOU WILL NOT LOOK TO THE DARKNESS

YOU KNOW WHAT IT HOLDS

WE WILL STAND TOGETHER AND FACE IT.

....

WE ARE THE DESTROYERS

FOREVER TIED TO STRUGGLE AND THE TRIUMPH

WE HOLD NOTHING BACK AND FEAR NO OUTCOME

NONE CAN MATCH US...ALL FEAR US

DYING EMBERS OF THE FIRE SOW OUR FATE

FOR OUR HEARTS ARE BOLD AND TIED TO PASSION

WITH OUR SHOUTS THE WALLS SHAKE

WITH OUR GAZE THE STRONG TREMBLE

YOU ARE THAT DESTROYER NOW

WE WILL FORGE YOU ANNEW

YOU WILL KNOW THE MEANING OF OUR STRENGTH

AS ONE WHO STANDS ALONE YOU WILL RISE
